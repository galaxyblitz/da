Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## What is TDD?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle.

### How does it work?

First the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## What is the sequence?

* Add a test
* Run all tests and see if the new one fails
* Write some code
* Run tests
* Refactor code
* Repeat
